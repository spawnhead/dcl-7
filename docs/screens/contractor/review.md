# contractor — Review

## Verdict
READY (documentation baseline with explicit UNKNOWNs).

## Completed
- Created required spec-pack artifacts.
- Extracted initial UI fields/actions from JSP.
- Captured verification backlog explicitly.

## Remaining
- Deep trace of routes, DAO SQL, DB invariants and runtime evidence.

## SQL Review Gate (Patch 0.5+)
- [x] SQL Schema verified (table/column candidates noted).
- [x] Triggers/constraints/procedures reviewed at naming/association level.
- [ ] Full action->DAO->SQL runtime trace completed (if still UNKNOWN in `questions.md`).
