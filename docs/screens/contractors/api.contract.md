# contractors — Expected API contracts (legacy-inferred)

- UNKNOWN in normalized pass; derive from screen forms/actions and existing docs (TEST_DATA_SPEC.md; SNAPSHOT.md; ACCEPTANCE.md; CONTRACTS.md; BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md).

## SQL constraint alignment (Patch 0.5+)
- Request payload fields must respect SQL types/lengths/NOT NULL from mapped tables.
- Exact field-to-column mapping: UNKNOWN (requires action/DAO SQL trace).
